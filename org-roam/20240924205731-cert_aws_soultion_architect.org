**** Autoscaling
***** Scaling policy
minimum, desired and max instances
- manual: all operations are done manually
- dynamic: 3 types:
****** target tracking policy
This policy adjusts the number of instances in a way that keeps a specific metric, such as CPU utilization or request count, close to a target value.
=ASGAverageCPUUtilization= for an ~AWS EC2~, network =ASGAverageNetworkIn=

****** simple scaling policy
Must set and use ~AWS cloudwatch~ alarm (high usage/low usage). you can control the scaling process e.g. 50-70 add 2 ~EC2~, 85-100 add 5 ~EC2~
****** step scaling policy
caling adjusts the capacity based on step adjustments instead of a target

- scheduled
For predicatable and known loads

***** EC2 specific
you must specify a launch template for the new ~EC2~ to use. e.g. what ~AWS EC2 AMI/size/SG/IAM/EBS volume~ to use.

***** Misc
****** cooldown period
The cooldown period is the amount of time to wait for a previous scaling activity to take effect is called the cooldown period.
****** update EC2 isntance part of a scaling gruppen
Put the instance in Standby mode. Post upgrade, move instance back to InService mode. It will be part of the same auto-scaling group
****** autoscaling termination policy
Termination policy is used to specify which instances to terminate first during scale-in
****** warm pool
 Auto Scaling Warm Pool is a collection of pre-initialized EC2 Instances sitting along with your Auto Scaling Group
****** Hibernation
Hibernation of the Amazon EC2 instance can be used in the =case of memory-intensive applications= or if =applications take a long time to bootstrap=. Hibernation pre-warms the instance, and after resuming it, it quickly brings all application processes to a running state. When an instance is hibernated, the Amazon EC2 instance saves all the content of the instance memory RAM to Amazon EBS volumes. Any root EBS volumes or attached EBS volumes are persisted during hibernation.
****** autoscaling for dbs (data loss) post shutdown
Adding Lifecycle Hooks to the Auto Scaling group puts the instance into a wait state before termination. During this wait state, you can perform custom activities to retrieve critical operational data from a stateful instance. The Default Wait period is 1 hour.

**** ELB
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It monitors the health of its registered targets and routes traffic only to the healthy targets.

***** Listeners
A listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure. Before you start using your Application Load Balancer, you must add at least one listener.

***** Target group (which servers request are forwarded too)
Target groups route requests to individual registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify.

***** Application load balancer
Supports Http/https and allows for advanced rerouting. e.g. http -> https redirect,
Can allow filtering on GET/POST request or host header rules e.g. blog.website.com -> redirect to ~Target group~ named blog containing dedicated ~AWS EC2~ or path e.g. blog.website.com/store
mostly used for web apps (direct traffic to the right EC2)

***** Network load balancer
Supports TCP, UDP, and TLS

The NLB creates and attaches ~ENIs~ (virtual network interfaces) to the subnets you specify during setup. These ENIs represent the entry points for traffic in each Availability Zone.

***** Misc
****** Cross-zone load balancing
If not enabled it only goes to a specific zone

**** API Gateway
Amazon API Gateway enables you to create and deploy your own REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. You can create robust, secure, and scalable APIs that access Amazon Web Services or other web services, as well as data that’s stored in the AWS Cloud.

- Backend integration complexity
- api management and deployment (versioning)

[[file:AWS_Solution_Architect/2024-10-06_19-18-12_screenshot.png]]

*****  Standard queues
Standard queues ensure at-least-once message delivery, but due to the highly distributed architecture, more than one copy of a message might be delivered, and messages may occasionally arrive out of order.

***** FIFO
FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues have all the capabilities of the standard queues, but are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, or where duplicates can't be tolerated.

***** Dead letter queues
Amazon SQS supports dead-letter queues (DLQs), which source queues can target for messages that are not processed successfully. DLQs are useful for debugging your application because you can isolate unconsumed messages to determine why processing did not succeed.

***** Visibility timeout
When a consumer receives a message from an Amazon SQS queue, the message remains in the queue but becomes temporarily invisible to other consumers. This temporary invisibility is controlled by the visibility timeout
***** Misc
****** ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible
pproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible describes the number of messages available for retrieval. It can be used to decide the queue length.
****** ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible
ApproximateNumberOfMessagesNotVisible measures the number of messages in flight.

**** AWS MQ
Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service that makes it easy to set up and operate message brokers in the cloud. Amazon MQ provides interoperability with your existing applications and services.

| Resource type              | Amazon SNS | Amazon SQS | Amazon MQ |

AWS Systems Manager provides the following capabilities for accessing, managing, and configuring your managed nodes. A managed node is any machine configured for use with Systems Manager in a hybrid and multicloud environment.

Feels like terraform should control said changes. I do see it being usefull for DB changes.

**** Service Catalog
AWS Service Catalog enables IT administrators to create, manage, and distribute portfolios of approved products to end users, who can then access the products they need in a personalized portal. Typical products include servers, databases, websites, or applications that are deployed using AWS resources

**** License Manager
~AWS License Manager~ indeed enables organizations to track both ~AWS-provided licenses~ and custom licenses (3rd party) procured independently. It provides visibility into license usage, helps in controlling usage to ensure compliance with licensing terms, and offers features like License Manager rules to set up licensing rules.

does not automatically purchase or allocate additional licenses when usage exceeds predefined thresholds.

**** Proton
AWS Proton creates and manages standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for developers and their serverless and container-based applications.

I dare say that terraform modules does that

**** Resource group and tag manager
AWS Resource Explorer is a resource search and discovery service. With Resource Explorer, you can explore your resources, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances, Amazon Kinesis streams, or Amazon DynamoDB tables, using an internet search engine-like experience.

**** Resilience hub
AWS Resilience Hub helps you proactively prepare and protect your AWS applications from disruptions. AWS Resilience Hub provides resiliency assessment and validation to help you identify and resolve issues before releasing applications into production.

Acts as an overseer

***** Recovery point objective (RPO)
The maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point. This determines what is considered an acceptable loss of data between the last recovery point and the interruption of service.

***** Recovery time objective (RTO)
The maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This determines what is considered an acceptable time window when service is unavailable.

**** Resource Explorer
Simply search and discovery of AWS resources accross regions

**** Resource Access Manager

**** IAM
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as access keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access.
Least Privilege Principle

***** User
An IAM user is an entity that you create in your AWS account. The IAM user represents the human user or workload who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS resources. A IAM user consists of a name and credentials.

***** Group
An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users.

***** Role
An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.  a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

***** Policy
Dictate permission a user has access to.

**** IAM Identity Center (SSO)
IAM Identity Center provides one place where you can create or connect workforce users and centrally manage their access to all of their AWS accounts and applications. Workforce users benefit from a single sign-on experience and can use the AWS access portal to find all their assigned AWS accounts and applications.

**** Cognito
Amazon Cognito handles user authentication and authorization for your web and mobile apps. With user pools, you can easily and securely add sign-up and sign-in functionality to your apps.

***** User pool
An Amazon Cognito user pool is a user directory for web and mobile app authentication and authorization. A user pool adds layers of additional features for security, identity federation, app integration, and customization of the user experience.

The user are given a token.

***** Identity pool
An Amazon Cognito identity pool is a directory of federated identities that you can exchange for AWS credentials. Identity pools generate temporary AWS credentials for the users of your app

Allows for the user to access AWS resources (upload to an S3)

**** Directory Service
MS Active Dir: Directory service created by microsoft which enable administrator to managed permissions + access to different services/applications.

AWS Directory Service provides multiple ways to set up and run Microsoft Active Directory with other AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS for SQL Server, FSx for Windows File Server, and AWS IAM Identity Center.

TL;DR AWS Managed Microsoft AD managed accross multiple availability zones.

***** Simple AD
Does not integrate with on-prems but easy integration
***** Managed Ms AD
actual implementation, on AWS, of MS AD
***** AD Connnector
if you have ms AD on prems you don't have to get a duplicate

**** Verified permissions
Amazon Verified Permissions is a scalable, fine-grained permissions management and authorization service for custom applications built by you.
attribute-based access control (ABAC) to manage permission as opposed to Role-baed access control (RBAC) used in k8s

***** Differences between IAM
IAM Permissions are for AWS resources (e.g., S3, EC2, Lambda).
AWS Verified Permissions are for application-level access control, extending beyond AWS services to control actions within an application.

**** CloudTrail
With AWS CloudTrail, you can monitor your AWS deployments in the cloud by getting a history of AWS API calls for your account, including API calls made by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS SDKs, the command line tools, and higher-level AWS services. You can also identify which users and accounts called AWS APIs for services that support CloudTrail, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred.

TL;DR: audit trails, stores for 30days, longer needs to go in a s3 bucket and query through elastic search
Cloudtrail can trigger ~AWS CloudWatch~ alarms which then generates a ~eventbrdige/sns~ which can lead to an ~lambda~

**** AWS Config
AWS Config provides a detailed view of the resources associated with your AWS account, including how they are configured, how they are related to one another, and how the configurations and their relationships have changed over time.

Great for auditing the changes to one's resource/app. Analogy librarian keeping track of the state and status of books throughout their lifetime

**** Artifacts
~AWS Artifact~ is a web service that enables you to download AWS security and compliance documents such as ISO certifications and SOC reports. Works for GDPR.

You can download the report and submit to the auditor directly

**** AWS GuardDuty
Amazon GuardDuty is a fully managed and advanced threat detection service providing broad protection to AWS Accounts and workloads. It helps to identify threats like attacker reconnaissance, instance compromise, account compromise, and bucket compromise.

Uses machine learning and threat inteligence. Collects logs such as ~cloudtrail~, ~vpc flow logs~, ~dns logs~ which then can trigger a ~lambda~.
If something happens, it generates a finding and gives it a severity score.
You can give it a trusted IP list (safe IPs) and a threat IP list (generated from org or taken elsewhere)

***** GuardDuty detection categories
- reconnainssance
- instance compromise
- account compromise
- bucket compromise

**** Inspector
Amazon Inspector is a security vulnerability assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of your AWS resources. Amazon Inspector automatically assesses resources for vulnerabilities or deviations from best practices, and then produces a detailed list of security findings prioritized by level of severity.

You must specify the resources to scan (assessment target) _Focused on the workloads_
Check for the following:
- package vulnerability
- code vulnerability
- network reachability

**** AWS Macie
_Focused on s3_
Amazon Macie is a data security service that discovers sensitive data (Personnaly Identifiable Infromation ~PII~) by using machine learning and pattern matching, provides visibility into data security risks, and enables automated protection against those risks.

To help you manage the security posture of your organization's Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) data estate, Macie provides you with an inventory of your S3 buckets, and automatically evaluates and monitors the buckets for security and access control.

**** Security hub
AWS Security Hub provides a consolidated view of your security status in AWS. Automate security checks, manage security findings, and identify the highest priority security issues across your AWS environment.

Central dashboard for the following:
- GuardDuty
- Inspector
- Macie
- External security tools
- lambda

Example flow:
~AWS Inspector~ detect a vulnerability in a ~AWS EC2~ Generate + share findings in ~AWS security Hub~ and triggers an event on ~AWS EventBridge~ or ~AWS SNS~ which invokes a ~lambda~ or ~step function~ or ~system manager~

**** KMS
AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management service scaled for the cloud. AWS KMS keys and functionality are used by other AWS services, and you can use them to protect data in your own applications that use AWS.

Can apply policies to keys dictating which users can use said key and what operation
keys can encrypt/decrypt/sign/verify files
kms monitoring: ~AWS cloudtrail~ ~AWS cloudwatch~
data key: encrypt large amount of data. Encrypted data key can be stored in the s3 bucket. We still need the kms key to decrypt the encrypted data key to paintext
imported key:
AWS managed keys: AWS manage them on behalf of us. little control used for services using encryption ~sqs~, ~s3~, ~ebs~

***** Asymmtric KMS keys
It is more secure as two keys are used here- one for encryption and the other for decryption.

Asymmetric KMS Keys represent a mathematically related RSA or elliptic curve (ECC) public and private key pair. The private key never leaves AWS KMS unencrypted. Asymmetric keys are used for digital signature applications such as trusted source code, authentication/authorization tokens, document e-signing, e-commerce transactions, and secure messaging.

Does not support encryption for services like s3, lambda, dynamoDB, etc.

***** Customer managed keys
 Customer managed keys are KMS keys in an AWS account that the customer creates, owns, and manages. The customer has full control over these KMS keys, including establishing and maintaining their key policies, IAM policies, grants, etc. Customer- managed keys do not support =digital signature verification=.

***** Symmetric keys
Security is less as only one key is used for both encryption and decryption purpose.

S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, etc integrate with KMS, and only symmetric encryption KMS key can be used here to encrypt the data. Also, the requirement of having the same 256-bit encryption key to encrypt and decrypt the data indicates a Symmetric KMS Key.

**** CloudHSM
AWS CloudHSM combines the benefits of the AWS cloud with the security of hardware security modules (HSMs). A hardware security module (HSM) is a computing device that processes cryptographic operations and provides secure storage for cryptographic keys.

Central location to encrypt/decrypt data. keys never leave the physical server. AWS manages it for you in the cloud as opposed as you having on prem.

You have full control (not AWS) on the keys. Can use clusters for scalability

**** Certificate manager
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) handles the complexity of creating, storing, and renewing public and private SSL/TLS X.509 certificates and keys that protect your AWS websites and applications. You can provide certificates for your integrated AWS services either by issuing them directly with ACM or by importing third-party certificates into the ACM management system

Careful you can blow the budget wiht them (form experience)

Can't be used for ~EC2/s3/lambda~. You should use for ~cloudfront~, ~ELB~, ~API Gateway~
region specific

**** Private Certificate authority
AWS Private CA enables creation of private certificate authority (CA) hierarchies, including root and subordinate CAs, without the investment and maintenance costs of operating an on-premises CA

Think of a country waiting to issue their bank notes
_Meant for internal communication only_ not on the internet

**** Secret Manager
AWS Secrets Manager helps you to securely encrypt, store, and retrieve credentials for your databases and other services. Instead of hardcoding credentials in your apps, you can make calls to Secrets Manager to retrieve your credentials whenever needed.
***** Automatic Secret Rotation:
Secrets Manager is ideal if you need automatic secret rotation. For example, rotating database credentials or API keys regularly without manual intervention.

***** Comprehensive Secret Management:
If you have complex secret management needs, like versioning, automatic rotation, or frequent updates to sensitive credentials, Secrets Manager provides a more advanced solution.

***** Detailed Monitoring and Compliance:
Secrets Manager offers detailed audit logging, which can help with compliance standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC 2, and you need to tightly monitor who accesses your secrets.
**** NACL/Security group
Reminder NACL acts at the subnet level while Security group acts at the application level. SG are disable all by default. Each rule only add to the allow. SG rules are merged together e.g. if you have multiple SG for one EC2 they get merged into one.

**** Security Lake
Amazon Security Lake is a fully managed security data lake service. You can use Security Lake to automatically centralize security data from AWS environments, SaaS providers, on premises, cloud sources, and third-party sources into a purpose-built data lake that's stored in your AWS account.

As any lake, it makes a copy of all the data.
collect -> store logs into s3 bucket -> normalilize AWS logs -> query/access data

**** WAF
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP(S) requests that are forwarded to your protected web application resources. You can protect the following resource types:

sits behind ~cloudfront~, ~API gateway~, or ~ELB~

**** shield
AWS provides two levels of protection against DDoS attacks: AWS Shield Standard and AWS Shield Advanced. AWS Shield Standard is automatically included at no extra cost beyond what you already pay for AWS WAF and your other AWS services. For _added protection against DDoS attacks_, AWS offers AWS Shield Advanced.

DDos consumes alot of your resources, AWS will not bill you for the resources taxed during the attack. You also get AWS shield response team (SRT)

**** Network Firewall
AWS Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for your virtual private cloud (VPC) that you create in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).

has to be in its own subnet and forward traffic to the subnet containing our resources. Must configure the ~route table~ proprely.

traffic comes from the ~IGW~ to the firewal subnet, goes to the firewal endpoint for inspection.

Can make use of a transit gateway so that you do not duplicate the firewall. otherwise its one per VPC.

**** Firewall Manager
AWS Firewall Manager simplifies your administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and resources for a variety of protections, including AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, Amazon VPC security groups and network ACLs, AWS Network Firewall, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall

kinda like ~control tower~
