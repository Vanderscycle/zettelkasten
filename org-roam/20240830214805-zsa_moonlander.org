** Troubleshooting
*** Keyboard is stuck on green light
    If Wally is open, close it, and unplug your keyboard.
    While the keyboard is still unplugged, using an un-bent paper clip, press your keyboard's reset button and keep it pressed while plugging the keyboard back in.
    Keep the reset button pressed for another 3 to 4 seconds before releasing it. (The keyboard will not function at this point; this is expected.)
    Open Wally and see if you can go through the flashing process.
*** Unable to update firmware
    If you have a =kvm= switch its possible that the interferance comes from there. plug the keybaord to a dedicated computer.
