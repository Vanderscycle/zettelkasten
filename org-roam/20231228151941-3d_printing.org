** Klipper
*** Filament runout sensor
Current configuration for btt_sfs sensor, however it gives plenty of false runout.

** Rat Rig V-minion
The goal of the printer is to be able to print PLA at .3 layer height, while being able to print petg
*** Current upgrades
- [Hotend] [[https://www.sliceengineering.com/products/mosquito-magnum-hotend][mosquito magnum]] 30mm3/s

** Peopoly Magneto X
The goal of the printer is to be able to print high quality ABS, Nylon, and ASA. These filament may be of the carbon fiber type so possibly quite abrasive

** Wanted upgrades
- [Klipper/hardware] Auto z-offset
- [Klipper] only probe the printed surface
- [Peopoly] Use [[https://beacon3d.com/product/beacon/][beacon surface scaner]] but on a bigger printer
- [Peopoly] Fully enclosed
