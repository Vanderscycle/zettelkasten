#+title: Emacs - Maggit

* Maggit

** Resolving conflicts
  - Open Magit status with M-x magit-status.
  - Navigate to the conflicted file and press RET to visit it.
  - In the buffer, navigate to the conflict.
  - Press e on the conflicting hunk to start the ediff session, which is a powerful tool for merging and resolving conflicts.
  - Ediff will open a new interface with multiple windows, showing both sides of the conflict and a merge result window. Use a or b to choose the version from either side (HEAD or main in your case).
  - Once you've resolved the conflict, you can save and exit the ediff session by following the prompts, which usually involve pressing q to quit and then confirming to save the merged file.
