* Git
** Installing on your machine
*** Windows
First I really recommend that you install =Windows PowerShell=. Its a better commandline interface for Windows. [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4#winget][Installing PowerShell on Windows - PowerShell | Microsoft Learn]]

Download the Git installed for windows [[https://gitforwindows.org/][Git for Windows]], it contains ~Bourne Again Shell (BASH)~ which is used to communicate between the user and the OS.

*** Mac
Check the Linux section,

*** Linux
I believe in you, you made it this far. It should come by default on your distro, if not that means you have one of these lightweight distribution so you already know what to do.

*** Generating an SSH key
To ensure security and prove who you are, GitHub uses ~Secure Shell (SSH)~. The SSH Protocol is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network.

To use ~SSH~ you must first generate a private key using the command bellow then follow the prompts
#+begin_src bash
  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
#+end_src

For SSH to work you also need the ~SSH-Agent~ to be running
#+begin_src bash
  # start the ssh-agent in the background
  Get-Service -Name ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Manual
  Start-Service ssh-agent
  # then tell ssh about your key. If not sure what is the name you gave it check the .ssh folder
  ssh-add c:/Users/YOU/.ssh/id_ed25519 # or your choosen file.
#+end_src

INFO: Never ever share this key. If you accidentaly do so you must invalidate it soonest.

*** Telling Github about your SSH key
Copy your =Public= key, you can tell which one is public as it ends with a =.pub=.
#+begin_src bash
clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
#+end_src

For linux you can use ~xclip~ or simply open the file with any editor and copy the content manually

- Go to Github (ensure you have an account, its easy to create one)
- Go to settings (upper right corner of the page by clicking on your profile picture)
- Go to SSH and GPG keys

- Test your connection with ~Git Bash~
#+begin_src bash
ssh -T git@github.com
#+end_src

** Using Git
Honestly, me explaining it won't help you very much. Its best to test it yourself. [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world][Hello World - GitHub Docs]]
