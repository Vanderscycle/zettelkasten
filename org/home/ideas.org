* Patterns
** Zettelkasten - note taking

   :END:


1. Capture fleeting/litterature/concept notes
2. Review and convert, at a later date, to permananent if they meet 2 criterias
   - Produce a similar level of excitment as when first captured?
     - Does this note add value to other permanent notes?
3. when rewritting a note to a permanent note, aim to improve it through connections to other notes.
4. Permanent notes should have keywords, links, location code - title
*** Emergent thinking
1. Follow a bottom-up approach allow one's to follow its interest through curiousity instead of a top down where one write an outline then follows it.
2. Follow your interest, and let your notes create the topics.

REMEMBER, Writting is thinking; not copying. Use your own words; distill the meaning.
